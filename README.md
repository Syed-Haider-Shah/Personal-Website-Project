Welcome to RenoPilots

Introduction

The RenoPilots website began as my personal sandbox, a place where I could put the skills acquired during my developmental phase as a programmer into practice. Over time, it has evolved into a dynamic portfolio, showcasing the breadth of features I’ve mastered throughout my career and serving as a living canvas for any new techniques I assimilate. While it may not be a specialized website with a singular focus, it represents a tapestry of my formative years in development and the knowledge I’ve accumulated. Currently, it functions as a valuable code repository, offering me the opportunity to revisit my past work, reflect on my growth, and apply fresh insights to refine my craft.

Technologies Used

Development Tools

ReactJs | JavaScript | Node | Express | NoSQL | MongoDB | Vercel

The front end of the application is made with ReactJS and JavaScript for its development. The choice of ReactJS over traditional HTML/CSS was strategic; it not only streamlines the workflow but also aligns with the preferences of industry experts. On the back end, Express was selected for its simplicity and effectiveness, allowing me to concentrate on resolving the intricate bugs that emerge when integrating with the front end.

For data management, MongoDB Atlas was the go-to choice. I was already familiar with SQL which prompted a desire to broaden my expertise into the realm of NoSQL databases, with MongoDB being the standout option during my selection process. Deployment is handled through Vercel, chosen for its generous offering of an indefinite free tier, unlike AWS.

Technical Features

User Types
RenoPilots has three distinct user roles: Homeowner, Provider, and Contributor. While the majority of the site’s content is accessible to all users, certain areas are tailored exclusively for each role. The Homeowner enjoys exclusive access to their dedicated portal and can also navigate the Providers Page. Providers have their own specialized portal in addition to the Providers Page. Contributors, on the other hand, are granted exclusive entry to the Contributor’s portal, with the Providers Page being the only exception to their access.

Dynammic Navbar
The Navbar dynamically adapts to the user’s role, altering its options to match the logged-in user’s profile. It also shifts colors on differnt pages to harmonize with the distinct aesthetics of each page. On the homepage, it also changes color on differnt levels of scroll. it presents an initial state of transparency, seamlessly transitioning to a solid color upon scrolling, adding a layer of visual engagement as users navigate the site.


Inventory System
The Item Display Page and the Cart are integral components designed to enhance my proficiency with the useContext hook and cookie management. Initially, the Cart page greets users with an empty state, inviting them to explore the Item Display Page. Here, they can select products to add to their cart, which dynamically updates to reflect their choices. Throughout the user session, the cart’s contents are maintained, ensuring a seamless shopping experience.


Image Slider
The majority of the components including the Image Slider are designed from scratch without the use of any prebuilt libraries, to better understand the inner workings of JS. The Image Slider is designed with seamless transitions and built with accessibility in mind, ensuring a user-friendly experience. You can visit the Image Slider page by selecting it on the Navbar.

Components
Each page has different cards and components showcasing different features, each of them build without using a library. The homepage displays a parallax component that creates an engaging visual effect, dynamically altering its position in response to user scrolling. The Profile Keys, Contributors, and Item Display pages feature unique card designs that enhance the user interface. The Homeowner’s portal is animated with custom-designed effects, while the Provider’s portal showcases a different set of bespoke animations, adding a touch of personality and sophistication to the user experience.
